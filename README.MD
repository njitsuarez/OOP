# Object Oriented Programing Tutorial
![OOP](https://www.studytonight.com/python/images/oops-concept-basic.png)
### Abstraction
Abstraction and encapsulation are often used synonymous with each other. 
Abstraction is achieved through encapsulation and refers to the steps taken within the function.
The steps taken to create a square using turtle in python is a good example of inheritance.

### Inheritance
"Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version
of an existing class" or "the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing
class".(Downey)
Python class inheritance allows for attributes and methods to be inherited from a parent class.  
This allows for the creation of a subclass and get all the functionality of the parent class and we can write new functionality w/o effecting the parent class in anyway.
#### 3 Benefits of using Inheritance
1.  Less code repetition
1. Structured Code: By dividing the code into classes, software can be structured better by dividing functionality into classes.
1. Makes the code scalable.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is using the same function name for different types or the use of the interface 
w/ input of different datat-ypes, class(es) or inputs.
