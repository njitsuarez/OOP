# Object Oriented Programing Tutorial using My Calculator Program
My calculator program is a program that performs basic arithmetic operations.

###Abstraction
Abstraction and encapsulation are often used synonymous with each other. 
Abstraction is achieved through encapsulation and refers to the steps taken within the function.
The steps taken to create a square using turtle in python is a good example of inheritance.

###Inheritance
"Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version
of an existing class" or "the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing
class".(Downey)
